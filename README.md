# padfoot

A pdf page rejigger.

Inspired by `pdftk` and `stapler`.

## Use

### info

Much as in `stapler`.

    > padfoot info file.pdf

    > padfoot info file1.pdf file2.pdf

## Alternatives

Unlike `pdftk`, doesn’t need a latex installation.
Unlike `stapler`, doesn’t need a python installation.

Also unlike those tools, it doesn’t yet work.
